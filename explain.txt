i have the following raid devices

/dev/md0:
/dev/md1:
/dev/md2:
/dev/md3:
/dev/md4:

let's look at md0

it says it is a RAID 1 mirror array

```
Raid Level : raid1
Array Size : 8388544 (8.00 GiB 8.59 GB)
```

we know what disks it is on by looking here:

```
 Number   Major   Minor   RaidDevice State
       0       8       17        0      active sync   /dev/sata2p1
       1       8       33        1      active sync   /dev/sata3p1
       2       8        1        2      active sync   /dev/sata1p1
       -       0        0        3      removed
```

i only have three disks installed in the system. it shows that there is a partition (p1) on each of my three disks. and it is showing that the md0 raid array is a raid of these partitions. 

as an FYI, this is the partition where DSM is installed. 

if we look at md1 (which is where the disk swapp is stored) it is also a raid 1 mirror array

```
Raid Level : raid1
     Array Size : 2097088 (2047.94 MiB 2147.42 MB)
  Used Dev Size : 2097088 (2047.94 MiB 2147.42 MB)
```

we can see what disks it is on here:

```
    Number   Major   Minor   RaidDevice State
       0       8       18        0      active sync   /dev/sata2p2
       1       8       34        1      active sync   /dev/sata3p2
       2       8        2        2      active sync   /dev/sata1p2
       -       0        0        3      removed
```

as we can see there is a second partition on each of my disks, (p2) and the md1 is a raid array of these partitions


synology SHR does this same thing.

let's say we have four disks with the following size:

```
disk 1: 2TB
disk 2: 4TB
disk 3: 5TB
disk 4: 6TB
```


DSM will make a 2TB partition on all disks, and make a raid array out of these 4x partitions. it will make a raid 5 for SHR1 and raid 6 array for SHR2. so we now have 

4x 2TB partitions in either raid 5 or raid 6 to make let's say ```"array#1"``` that is either 6TB if SHR1 or 4TB if SHR2

we now have the following space REMAINING in each disk

```
disk 1: 0 bytes
disk 2: 2TB
disk 3: 3TB
disk 4: 4TB
```

DSM will make a 2TB partition on disks 2, 3, and 4, and make a raid array out of these 3x partitions. it will make a raid 5 for SHR1 and raid 6 array for SHR2. so we now have 

3x 2TB partitions in either raid 5 or raid 6 to make let's say ```"array#2"``` that is either 4TB if SHR1 or 2TB if SHR2

we now have the following space REMAINING in each disk

```
disk 1: 0 bytes
disk 2: 0 bytes
disk 3: 1TB
disk 4: 3TB
```

DSM will make a 1TB partition on disks 3 and 4, and make a RAID 1 array 

2x 1TB partitions in raid 1 make let's say ```"array#3"``` that is 1TB in size

and so on until it uses all the space

now, the EXACT size, raid config etc will be dependent on number of disks and their sizes compared to each other.
